\title{Within-Quantile Test for Coefficient Equality}
\usage{
within_quantile_test(
  estimation,
  order,
  boots,
  taus,
  variables,
  export = TRUE,
  file = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{estimation}{List. Estimation results obtained from \code{coef_estimate()}.}

\item{order}{Integer vector. ARDL orders for each variable, typically obtained
from \code{order_find()}. The length must match the number of variables in the
data. The first element should be the dependent variable.}

\item{boots}{Integer. Number of bootstrap replications used in the estimation.
This should match the value used in \code{coef_estimate()}.}

\item{taus}{Numeric vector. All quantile levels estimated, same as the
\code{taus} parameter in \code{coef_estimate()}.}

\item{variables}{Character vector. Names of explanatory variables to test
for equality. Must contain at least two variable names and cannot include
the dependent variable. All variables must have positive ARDL orders.}

\item{export}{Logical. Whether to export the results to a file. Default is TRUE.}

\item{file}{Character. File path for exporting results. Required if export = TRUE.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing Wald test results for each quantile level, including:
\itemize{
\item Variable: Concatenated variable names tested for equality
\item term: Type of coefficient tested ("Long" or "Short")
\item Wald: Wald test statistic with significance stars (***p<0.01, **p<0.05, *p<0.1)
\item pvalue: p-value of the test
\item Tau: The quantile level at which the test was performed
}
}
\description{
This function performs Wald tests to check if coefficients of multiple
explanatory variables are equal within each quantile level. It tests both
long-run and short-run coefficients separately for each quantile. This is
particularly useful for NARDL-type models where variables are decomposed
into multiple components.
