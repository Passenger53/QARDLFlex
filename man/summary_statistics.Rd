\title{Generate Summary Statistics for Data Frame Variables}
\usage{
summary_statistics(data, export = TRUE, file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables to analyze. If the first column
is named "date", it will be excluded from statistical calculations.}

\item{export}{Logical. If TRUE, results are exported to a file. Default is TRUE.}

\item{file}{Character. File path for exporting results. Required if export = TRUE.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per variable and columns for each statistic:
variable name, mean, median, maximum, minimum, standard deviation,
skewness, kurtosis, and Jarque-Bera test statistic with significance stars.

\examples{
# Generate sample data using sim_data_generate()
sample_data <- sim_data_generate(
  b = c(0.5, 0.7, 0.3, 0.2),
  order = c(1, 1),
  size = 100,
  reps = 1
)[[1]]

# Calculate summary statistics
stats <- summary_statistics(sample_data, export = FALSE)
print(stats)
