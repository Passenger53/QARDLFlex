\title{Generate Formula from Data Frame Columns}
\usage{
function_generate(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables for formula generation.
The function expects that the first column might be a "date" column (which is excluded),
and uses the second column as the dependent variable, with subsequent columns as independent variables.}
}
\value{
A formula object where the first variable (after excluding the first column) is the
dependent variable, and all remaining variables are independent variables joined by "+".
The formula has the structure: \code{second_column ~ third_column + fourth_column + ...}
}
\description{
This function automatically creates a formula object from the column names of a data frame.
It uses the first non-date column as the dependent variable and the remaining columns
as independent variables in the formula.
}
\examples{
# Generate sample data using sim_data_generate()
sample_data <- sim_data_generate(
  b = c(0.5, 0.7, 0.3, 0.2),
  order = c(1, 1),
  size = 100,
  reps = 1
)[[1]]

# Create formula from the data
model_formula <- function_generate(sample_data)
print(model_formula)
# Output: y ~ x1 + x2  (assuming the data has columns: date, y, x1, x2)
}
