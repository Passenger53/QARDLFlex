\title{Comprehensive Unit Root Testing for Multiple Variables}
\usage{
unitroot_test(data, export = TRUE, file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the time series variables to test.
If the first column is named "date", it will be excluded from testing.}

\item{export}{Logical. If TRUE, results are exported to a file. Default is TRUE.}

\item{file}{Character. File path for exporting results. Required if export = TRUE.}
}
\value{
A tibble with unit root test results for all variables at different
differencing levels, including test statistics with significance stars.
Results are organized by variable, differencing level, and test type.
}
\description{
This function performs multiple unit root tests (ADF, PP, KPSS, ERS, ZA) on all
numeric variables in a dataset at level, first difference, and second difference.
It provides a comprehensive stationarity analysis for time series variables.

\examples{
# Generate sample data using sim_data_generate()
sample_data <- sim_data_generate(
  b = c(0.5, 0.7, 0.3, 0.2),
  order = c(1, 1),
  size = 100,
  reps = 1
)[[1]]

# Perform unit root tests
unitroot_results <- unitroot_test(sample_data, export = FALSE)
print(unitroot_results)
