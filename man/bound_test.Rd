\title{Perform Bounds F Test for Cointegration}
\usage{
bound_test(data, order, export = TRUE, file = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the time series data. If the first column
is named "date", it will be automatically excluded from the analysis.}

\item{order}{Integer vector. ARDL lag orders for each variable, typically obtained
from \code{order_find()}. The length must match the number of variables in the
data frame (excluding date).}

\item{export}{Logical. If TRUE (default), exports results to a file.}

\item{file}{Character. File path for exporting results. Required if export = TRUE.}
}
\value{
The function displays test results in the console. If export = TRUE,
results are saved to the specified file. The test evaluates whether
there is a long-run cointegrating relationship among the variables.
}
\description{
This function performs the bounds F test for cointegration in ARDL models,
testing the null hypothesis of no long-run relationship between variables.

\examples{
# Generate sample data
sample_data <- sim_data_generate(
  b = c(0.5, 0.7, 0.3, 0.2),
  order = c(1, 1),
  size = 100,
  reps = 1
)[[1]]

# Find optimal lag order
optimal_order <- order_find(sample_data, selection = "BIC", export = FALSE)

# Perform bounds F test
bound_test(sample_data, order = optimal_order, export = FALSE)
}
